      <h2>COOKIE POLICY</h2>
      <p><strong>Last updated August 15, 2025</strong></p>

      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how VistaXM, Inc (“<strong>Company</strong>,”
        “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” and “<strong>our</strong>“) uses cookies and
        similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at
        https://www.vistaxm.com (“<strong>Website</strong>“). It explains what these technologies
        are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal
        information if we combine it with other information.
      </p>

      <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you
        visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites
        work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, VistaXM, Inc.) are called “first-party
        cookies.” Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third-party
        cookies.” Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided
        on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The
        parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits
        the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
      </p>

      <h3>Why do we use cookies?</h3>
      <p>
        We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for
        technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as “essential”
        or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the
        interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties
        serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is
        described in more detail below.
      </p>

      <h3>How can I control cookies?</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your
        cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent
        Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential
        cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our Website. If
        you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Website though your access to some
        functionality and areas of our Website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your
        web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Website and the
        purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific
        cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):
      </p>

      <h4>Essential website cookies:</h4>
      <p>
        These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our
        Website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
      </p>

      <h4>Performance and functionality cookies:</h4>
      <p>
        These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Website but are
        non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like
        videos) may become unavailable.
      </p>

      <h4>Analytics and customization cookies:</h4>
      <p>
        These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us
        understand how our Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or
        to help us customize our Website for you.
      </p>

      <h4>Advertising cookies:</h4>
      <p>
        These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform
        functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are
        properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are
        based on your interests.
      </p>

      <h3>How can I control cookies on my browser?</h3>
      <p>
        As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from
        browser to browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information. The
        following is information about how to manage cookies on the most popular browsers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chrome</li>
        <li>Internet Explorer</li>
        <li>Firefox</li>
        <li>Safari</li>
        <li>Edge</li>
        <li>Opera</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising.

      </ul>

      <h3>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h3>
      <p>
        Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other,
        similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking
        pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier
        that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email
        including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from
        one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to
        understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on
        a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email
        marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to
        function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
      </p>

      <h3>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h3>
      <p>
        Websites may also use so-called “Flash Cookies” (also known as Local Shared Objects or
        “LSOs”) to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our
        services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of
        your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website
        Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage
        Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that
        explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to “information” on
        the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without
        your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are
        not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies
        may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially,
        Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.
      </p>

      <h3>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h3>
      <p>
        Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising
        through our Website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and
        other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that
        you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the
        effectiveness of advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons
        to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide
        relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The
        information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your
        name, contact details, or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to
        provide these.
      </p>

      <h3>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</h3>
      <p>
        We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example,
        changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
        Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of
        cookies and related technologies.
      </p>
      <p>The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.</p>
